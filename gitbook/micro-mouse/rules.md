# Rules

The Micromouse competition is a popular robotics event where autonomous small robots (called micromice) are designed to navigate and solve a maze as quickly as possible. The competition has specific rules and guidelines that participants must follow. Here’s a summary of the key rules typically observed in Micromouse competitions:

#### 1. **Maze Structure:**

* The maze is a grid of cells, each typically 18 cm x 18 cm in size.
* The maze is bounded by walls that are generally 5 cm high and 1.2 cm thick.
* The maze dimensions usually vary, but a standard maze is 16x16 cells (256 cells total).
* There is a defined start cell, usually located at one corner of the maze.
* The goal is located at the center of the maze and may span multiple cells (e.g., a 2x2 grid of cells).

#### 2. **Robot Specifications:**

* The robot (micromouse) must fit within a square with sides of 25 cm at the start of the competition.
* There is no strict height limitation, but practical constraints usually keep the robots small.
* The robot must be autonomous and cannot receive external inputs or signals during the competition.
* It must not damage the maze or walls in any way.

#### 3. **Competition Rules:**

* **Start of the Run:**
  * The micromouse starts in the designated start cell. The time begins when the robot first moves from the start cell.
* **Solving the Maze:**
  * The robot must navigate from the start cell to the goal cell. It can explore the maze as many times as needed to find the shortest path to the goal.
  * The robot can return to the start cell to attempt the run again after gathering information about the maze.
  * The maze configuration remains the same throughout the competition.
* **Time Limits:**
  * There is usually a maximum time limit for the entire run, commonly around 10 minutes.
  * This time includes all explorations and final runs to the goal.
* **Scoring:**
  * The robot’s score is based on the time it takes to reach the goal cell during its fastest run.
  * Some competitions may penalize for wall collisions, taking too long to solve, or requiring human intervention.
  * The robot that solves the maze in the shortest time is the winner.

#### 4. **Human Intervention:**

* Once the run has started, no human intervention is allowed unless the robot needs to be reset. However, resetting the robot typically incurs a time penalty or other penalties.
* Any form of wireless communication with the robot after the start is usually prohibited.

#### 5. **Disqualification:**

* The robot may be disqualified if it consistently damages the maze, is non-functional, or violates other rules like leaving the maze boundaries or receiving external assistance.

#### 6. **Fair Play and Safety:**

* All participants must adhere to the rules of fair play.
* The design of the robot should ensure that it operates safely without posing a risk to people or the competition environment.

#### 7. **Environment Considerations:**

* The competition environment, such as lighting, is usually controlled, but participants must be prepared for minor variations.
* The maze may be inspected before the run, but details of the specific maze layout are unknown until the competition begins.

These rules can vary slightly depending on the organizing body or event, but the above guidelines cover the most common and essential aspects of a Micromouse competition.
